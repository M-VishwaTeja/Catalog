Electronic Voting System :

Voting is a method for a group of individuals to make a collective decision or voice their cumulative opinion to arrive at a consensus. The results of a vote can have far reaching consequences due to which it is imperative to maintain integrity by ensuring that there is no scope for fraud or cheating to occur while the votes are being cast. 

It is highly crucial that voting is carried out in a fair and just manner.

Core Features:

Voter ID Generation:

Incorporates a unique ID for anonymity of the voters to make sure a single voter does not cast the same vote multiple times.

Encryption Of The Votes:

Audit Log:

Relevant activity (e.g., voter ID production, voting, vote counting) shall be time-stamped in an audit log.
The audit log is saved in a file called audit_log.txt for transparency, possible later validation, and that there has been nothing shady.

All actions are also properly logged in an audit log.

Timestamped Voting:
